# IS452FinalProject_Fall2018

ABOUT:

The large programming project option was chosen as my final project. This option was chosen as it was felt to be more difficult but challenging with an outcome of learning more about Python and hopefully applying it to something of practical use now and in the future (to continue taming it with a purpose). 

The primary aim of this project will be to create a moderate python program that iterates through my personal Gmail account in order to provide a summary of emails by sender/vendor/company/etc. and tag key emails based some criteria of either who sent it, what is in the subject, or what is in the body. Fringe benefits may also include adding labels to emails, auto-forwarding to text, or even auto responses. 

DIRECTORY:

There are X files in this directory. 

  1. Final Project Narrative (MS Word): describes the  research conducted to gather instructions and knowledge of the approach and a walk through of code generation noting successful and unsuccessful attempts, lessons learned, and additional detailed background.
  2. Connection to Gmail (Jupyter Notebook): outlines coding blocks needed to establishing successful connections to gmail account and describes textual steps for each code blocks noting purpose and outcomes.
  3. Gmail Query Reporting (Jupyter Notebook): outlines coding blocks needed to generate sender/vendor/company count aggregations (and others TBD) to gmail account and describes textual steps for each code blocks noting purpose and outcomes.
  4. Project Coding Script (Python file): contains all coding blocks used in successive order with minimum comments for advanced reviewers and debugging
