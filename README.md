# IS452FinalProject_Fall2018

ABOUT:

The large programming project option was chosen as the final project. This option was chosen as it was felt to be more difficult but challenging with an outcome of learning more about Python and hopefully applying it to something of practical use now and in the future (to continue taming it with a purpose). 

The primary aim of this project will be to create a moderate python program that iterates through a personal Gmail account in order to provide a summary reflecting the total number of emails in the inbox and a top ten list of emails by sender/vendor/company/etc. 

DIRECTORY:

There are 4 files in this directory. 

  1. Final Project Narrative (MS Word): describes the  research conducted to gather instructions and knowledge of the approach and a walk through of code generation noting successful and unsuccessful attempts, lessons learned, and additional detailed background.
  2. Gmail Inbox Analysis (Jupyter Notebook): outlines coding blocks needed to establishing successful connections to gmail account and describes textual steps for each code blocks noting purpose and outcomes.
  3. Project Coding Script (Python file): contains all coding blocks used in successive order with minimum comments for advanced reviewers and debugging
  4. Sample Output Files (CSV and MS Word): provides examples of what outputs in the console should reflect and an example output CSV file 

QUICK START GUIDE:

Read through the Gmail Inbox Analysis notebook to gain an understanding of the overall program. 

!IMPORTANT! 
The Gmail acccount used must be enabled to read messages using POP (instructions can be found here: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7104828?hl=en&visit_id=636808522585272580-1177844093&rd=2) and the account setting must be configured to allow less secure apps to access (instruction can be found here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)

Download the Project Coding Script to a directory on your PC. Using a python interpreter shell run the script inputting information when prompted. Prompted information includes a Gmail user name, the corresponding Gmail password, the number of emails to analyze starting with the latest email in the inbox and descending according to the number supplied, and the number of days to be analyzed starting with today and descending in day increments. 

The program should result in a results summary displayed in the console and a CSV file listing the date, sender, and subject of qualifying emails. Refer to the Result Examples folder to visualize example output. 

The Project Narrative can be used to assist in any debugging of code errors. 

ENJOY!
